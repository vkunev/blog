                    <p>
                    For some time now, rumors have been swirling that Disney is planning to make a standalone movie about Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Jedi maser who helped both Anakin and Luke Skywalker grow into their gifts. What’s more, word has been that Disney would shoot the movie at Titanic Studios in Belfast, long the home base for Game of Thrones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But then, disaster struck, and by disaster, I mean a movie that only made a lot of money rather than all the money. Solo: A Star Wars Story, which starred Game of Thrones’ own Emilia Clarke in a lead role, underperformed at the box office, and soon rumors began to swirl that Disney was backing off its plan to make Star Wars standalone movies, including Obi-Wan’s solo outing.

                    <p>
                    Or not. When talking about the timetable for filming on a Game of Thrones prequel series (apparently it’s starting much sooner than we expected), the Belfast Telegraph casually mentioned that, according to sources at Titanic’s Paint Hall studio, the Obi-Wan film will shoot sometime in April of next year.

                    <p>
                    Star Wars creator George Lucas visited Northern Ireland before Christmas to seal the deal for the new standalone film. The movie will centre on the life of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Ewan McGregor reprising the role he first played in 1999’s Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Paint Hall source was all for it. “This is fantastic news for everyone at the studio – from the cast and the crew, right down to the riggers and the catering staff.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now, Disney hasn’t confirmed this news, but they also haven’t denied it and that’s enough for the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In January of this year, Ewan McGregor — wearing his trademark Obi-Wan beard — won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a TV Movie or Mini-Series for his work on Fargo season 3. The press asked him about returning to that galaxy far, far away. “It’s just that — there’s a lot of talk,” he said. “I’d be happy to play him again. I don’t know about it any more than you do.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So there’s smoke, but no fire as of yet. Until Disney makes it official, we’ll keep this bit of news in the rumor bin.

                    With Game of Thrones now in the rearview mirror, fans can catch Harington starring alongside Johnny Flynn (Jerome Flynn’s (Bronn) younger brother) in London in the Sam Shepherd play True West. Harington plays Austin, a neurotic screenwriter who’s on the cusp of success, but is held back by his “unpredictable and dangerous” brother Lee (Flynn), with whom he lives.
